# creating-DB-data

A repository containing the code used to generate data for a Database project, and a few small programs (in `other`) to fetch and parse data for tables of other colleagues.

`zeroPlayerGame.py` contains the code that generates all the data.

For an explanation of how I'm getting data from webpages, read [this article I wrote (Get data for your db schoolwork with 6 lines of python)](https://medium.com/@rodrigo.m.mesquita/get-data-for-your-db-schoolwork-with-6-lines-of-python-e68a108f65ff)
